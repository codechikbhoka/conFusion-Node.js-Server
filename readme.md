What exactly is Passport? Passport is an authentication middleware for use with your Node.js application. So, you can take passport and then plug it directly into your express as one of the middleware, and then you will have full support for user authentication. Passport is a very modular and flexible package. It supports many different strategies for user authentication. Of course, you have support for local strategy where you can manage your own user accounts with user name and password and then authenticate users locally.

Passport also supports the use of OpenID. Similarly Passport supports OAuth which is used by such companies as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and many others for providing user authentication including providing user authentication for third parties. So if you surf the internet and access many sites or even use many mobile applications, you can see that, many of these applications will allow you to sign in using your Facebook, Twitter, Google+, or other social media accounts. This is also quicker through Oauth.
